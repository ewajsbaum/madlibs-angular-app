    It was Erev Sukkos and <span [innerHTML]="entries.name | propernoun"></span> was on a hunt for an
    {{entries.adjective1 }} esrog. At his first stop, he asked the seller if he had any esrogim from <span
        [innerHTML]="entries.country | propernoun"></span>. The seller had to
    {{entries.verb1}} his inventory. He was {{entries.adjective2 }} when he saw that he did not.
    At the next seller, <span [innerHTML]="entries.name | propernoun"></span> met his good friend, <span
        [innerHTML]="entries.friend | propernoun"></span>. <span [innerHTML]="entries.friend | propernoun"></span>
    advised him to {{entries.verb2}} to a seller in <span [innerHTML]="entries.city | propernoun"></span>
    because his esrogim were {{entries.adjective3}}. At that point, <span
        [innerHTML]="entries.name | propernoun"></span> had already been {{entries.verb3}} for an
    esrog for {{entries.number}} {{entries.unitOfTime}} and his {{entries.bodyPart}} was hurting, but he
    {{entries.adverb1}} persevered. When he got to
    the store in <span [innerHTML]="entries.city | propernoun"></span>, he found a {{entries.adjective4}} esrog! He was
    so
    {{entries.emotion}}! The esrog was perfectly {{entries.colour}} and had a {{entries.adjective5}} pitom. It had a
    {{entries.adjective6}} {{entries.sense}} too. He was sure his {{entries.familyMember}} would approve!
    <span [innerHTML]="entries.name | propernoun"></span> {{entries.adverb2}} went back home, mission accomplished!
